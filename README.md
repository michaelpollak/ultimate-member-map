![Wordpress Users on a Geolocated on a Google Maps Map](https://github.com/michaelpollak/ultimate-member-map/SCREENSHOT_ultimate-member-map.png)
Geocode and display a number of Wordpress users on a map using the Google Maps API.
The usecase was a school [hakwt.at](http://hakwt.at/) that wanted to display where graduates are working and living. We set up a wordpress site and added [ultimate member](https://ultimatemember.com) as the social media plugin. We did not find a smart solution to geocode users with the Google Maps API and show them on a map. So we built this. I hope this helps somebody else out.

## Install
You need a Google Maps API key to use this functionality.
Put the file "page-heroes.php" in your theme directory.
Put the directory "heldinnen" in the same theme directory.
Put the content of this functions.php at the bottom of the functions.php file in your theme directory.
Add a field named ort (can be text or googlemap) to your ultimate member forms.
Add a field superkraft (text, textarea) to your ultimate member forms.
NOTE: These fieldnames can be changed in the variables in page-heroes.php and functions.php.
If you don't use "twentynineteen" as your theme, change the variable $theme in page-heroes.php.
Add your API key in $apikey in page-heroes.php as well as functions.php
In your wordpress interface, add a page named "heroes".
